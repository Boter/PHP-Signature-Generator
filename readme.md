Signature Generator
=======

A super simple script to help everyone that ever had to create an corporate HTML signature, this will fill all the information on a layout file and download it.

## Usage

It's dead simple to use this, just edit **layout.html** to have your signature code and replate the content with these **tags**

For the name

    [[NAME]] 

For the email

    [[EMAIL]]

For the main phone

    [[PHONE]]

For the mobile phone

    [[IF-MOBILE]][[MOBILE]][[ENDIF-MOBILE]]

*Since not everyone uses a mobile phone in their signature, there's a conditional for that line.*

You can have all the coding you want to have, just add these and the code will replace it for you!
